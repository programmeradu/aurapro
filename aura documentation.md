Project Documentation: Aura Command Pro - Enhanced Edition
1.0 Executive Vision
"Aura Command Pro" is an AI-powered, cinematic command center designed for Accra's public transport system with breakthrough 3D visualization and real machine learning capabilities. It moves beyond simple route optimization to create a resilient, profitable, and intelligent transport network powered by genuine AI predictions. Our core thesis is that the informal tro-tro system is a dynamic marketplace that can be guided and enhanced with cutting-edge AI, rather than replaced. We have built a high-fidelity prototype that not only solves deep, real-world problems but also delivers an unforgettable, "wow-factor" user experience, showcasing a future where AI serves as a true partner in urban planning.

2.0 The Core Problem Statement
The foundational data available for Accra's transport network is a GTFS feed from a single-trip data collection campaign conducted in May and June of 2015. This presents two major challenges:

Data Staleness: The data is a decade old and does not reflect Accra's current, vastly changed urban landscape. Any direct analysis is fundamentally flawed.

Lack of Formalism: As the documentation states, there are no fixed schedules; the provided timings are merely a snapshot from a single trip. The system is inherently dynamic and informal.

"Aura Command Pro" is designed to overcome these specific challenges by revitalizing the old data with modern sources and building AI models that embrace the network's dynamic nature rather than trying to force a rigid structure upon it.

3.0 The Solution: Key Features & Innovations (Pro Edition)
"Aura Command Pro" is a Streamlit application featuring a simulated, interactive dashboard with revolutionary 3D visualization and real machine learning capabilities. The experience is built around six core innovative features designed to score maximum points for innovation, impact, and presentation.

3.1 The "Live Fleet" Simulation with 3D Immersive Visualization
Instead of static lines on a 2D map, Aura Command Pro visualizes the tro-tro network as a living system using cutting-edge pydeck 3D visualization technology. The system features:
- Stunning 3D tilted perspective with 45-degree pitch angle
- Golden pathways representing AI-optimized routes rendered as real-time 3D paths
- Animated vehicle icons moving along golden routes with dynamic camera following
- Interactive transport hubs displayed as 3D scatter points with vibrant colors
- Immersive dark map styling for professional command center aesthetics

3.2 Real Machine Learning Travel Time Prediction Engine
Powered by a genuine scikit-learn Linear Regression model trained on the actual Accra GTFS dataset:
- Automated feature engineering from historical stop_times.txt and trips.txt data
- Real-time prediction API endpoint (/api/v1/predict/travel_time)
- Model trained on trip duration patterns and number of stops relationships
- Joblib model persistence for fast loading and reliable predictions
- Integration with FastAPI backend for seamless ML inference

3.3 AI-Powered Dynamic Fare & Incentive Engine
The AI analyzes simulated real-time demand to turn the transport network into a live marketplace:
- Surge Zones: In areas of high demand (e.g., after a concert), the AI suggests temporary, dynamic fare increases to attract more drivers
- Incentive Zones: In underserved areas, the AI creates "incentive zones," offering a financial bonus to drivers to ensure service equity and prevent transport deserts

3.4 Predictive Passenger Transfer Hub
This feature demonstrates a deep, network-level understanding of passenger flow. The AI analyzes and predicts how passengers move between different tro-tro routes at major interchanges (e.g., 37 Station, Circle). The goal is to optimize the entire passenger journey, including transfer times, by displaying connection flows in a stunning Sankey diagram.

3.5 Voice-Activated Scenarios (Voice AI)
The user interface is partially controllable by voice. The presenter can use commands like, "Aura, simulate market day traffic at Kaneshie," to trigger simulations, creating a highly engaging and futuristic demo experience.

3.6 The Generative AI Strategy Brief with AI Co-Pilot
After any simulation, the user can click "Generate Executive Brief." This feature uses an LLM (via API) to analyze the simulation's output data and generate a concise, insightful, natural-language summary of the situation and the recommended actions. This brief is also read aloud by the AI Co-Pilot (Text-to-Speech), giving Aura a voice and personality.
