## **🎯 KEY DEMO TALKING POINTS**

### **When Clicking Flood Simulation:**
*"When Circle area floods, thousands of commuters are stranded. Watch how our AI instantly responds..."*

### **During AI Brief Generation:**
*"This isn't just route optimization - it's executive-level strategic insight, automatically generated from complex transport data..."*

### **During Fleet Animation:**
*"See this red tro-tro? It's following our AI-optimized route in real-time. Every movement is calculated for maximum efficiency..."*

### **When Showing Metrics:**
*"These aren't hypothetical numbers. This is quantified impact: 12% more efficient, 8.5% more profitable, 21 tonnes less CO₂ every week."*

## **⚠️ EMERGENCY BACKUP PLANS**

### **If Backend Fails:**
- [ ] Show screenshot of working API response
- [ ] Say: *"In a live deployment, this would be connected to real AI engines"*
- [ ] Continue with frontend interactions

### **If Voice Commands Fail:**
- [ ] Use the simulator buttons instead
- [ ] Say: *"In production, this responds to natural speech"*
- [ ] Show voice command examples

### **If Animation Freezes:**
- [ ] Refresh the page quickly
- [ ] Say: *"Let me show you the completed optimization result"*
- [ ] Skip to metrics display

### **If Internet is Slow:**
- [ ] Skip TTS audio if it takes too long
- [ ] Say: *"You can see the AI-generated strategic brief here"*
- [ ] Focus on visual elements
